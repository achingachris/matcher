Consistency is what drives me towards attaining my goal.    
Another career goal is becoming a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer. I studied Social Work and Community Development and I have a Diploma on the same. When I begun practicing my career at Stretchers Youth Organization, I realized that there was a gap in Monitoring and Evaluation position. I begun acting like a monitoring and Evaluation Officer but I couldn't deliver the work as required since I was not an expert at it. I decided to challenge myself and that was when I begun dreaming of going back to school and sharpen my skills further. Learning is a continuous process and knowledge is power.

A person needs to be enlightened, to know about himself, to identify his own strength, abilities, and possibilities. 
Self-acceptance -refers to accepting one's own personality or image. There are many people who are unable to form a proper view of themselves and cannot take any decision.  In whatever form other people accept such people, they begin to accept them as their real nature. Their source of information about themselves is others point of view.
Social Cohesion -Being helpful in the social life of an individual is also considered to be another important goal of counseling. The emergence of various problems in our life is also due to not being able to make proper adjustments with society.

According to ONS from 2016 to 2018 just under 40% of households in Great Britain had levels of spending greater than their income, this means these families are overspending and most likely in debt. Debt and overspending are hard to manage and get rid of, they need to manage their finances and budget to start paying the debt back and stop overspending. This let me understand the importance of the finance industry in educating and helping individuals. The finance industry not only helps business manage their finance but also helps them grow, survive, and run their day-to-day activities as well as helps individuals plan for emergencies, get mortgages, and life insurance, manage their finances, and more. This is what interested me in the finance industry and led me to pursue this course.","Hard work.

","My financial goals are intertwined with my broader aspirations of creativity and impact. Firstly, I aim to build my own brand into a profitable venture by investing in branding, marketing, and product development. This will require a careful balance of revenue generation and investment to ensure sustainable growth.

Additionally, establishing a film production company is a significant financial endeavor. I'll need to allocate funds for equipment, talent, and production costs while ensuring the company remains financially viable in the competitive entertainment industry.

Providing employment opportunities for youths and creatives also involves financial considerations. Beyond the initial hiring costs, I'll need to budget for payroll, benefits, and operational expenses to support a thriving workforce.

Furthermore, as I impact numerous creatives, I must consider the financial implications of mentorship programs, workshops, and collaborative projects. While these initiatives may not directly generate revenue, they contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of my brand and business ventures.

Overall, my financial goals revolve around building profitable enterprises that not only generate revenue but also foster creativity, innovation, and positive social impact.",,,

As a young individual with aspirations for growth and impact, pursuing higher education became not just a goal but a pathway to self-discovery and empowerment. Throughout my academic journey, I embraced the challenges and opportunities presented, leveraging each experience to cultivate leadership qualities within myself. Earning a degree served as more than just an academic achievement; it was a transformative process that honed my critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Through rigorous coursework, collaborative projects, and extracurricular activities, I developed a deep understanding of my field of study while also gaining practical skills applicable to various aspects of life.
Beyond the classroom, I actively sought opportunities to engage in leadership roles, whether through student organizations, community service projects, or internships. These experiences allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations, navigate complex challenges, and inspire positive change within my community. As I reflect on my journey, I recognize that personal leadership is not merely about holding a title or position of authority; it is about embodying integrity, resilience, and vision in every aspect of life. Earning a degree was a crucial step in this journey, providing me with the knowledge, confidence, and perspective needed to lead with purpose and impact.
