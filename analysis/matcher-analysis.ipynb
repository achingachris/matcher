    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a generic LLM matchin algorithm which can be progressed as part of Swahilipot's matching of mentors and mentees, youth to opportunities etc. The algorithm has been developed to be as generic as possible, utilizing LLMs for identifying which fields \n",
    "to use in matching. It includes the following key components and being passed two dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An automatic analysis to determine fields to use for semantic search, locations and other types. This is controlled via an LLM prompt\n",
    "2. A basic semantic search to get matches for each row in dataframe 1 in dataframe 2\n",
    "3. For each match a distance is calculated using Google maps API to filter out matches which are too distant\n",
    "4. For each remaining match, and LLM judge asseses the full record to filter out any which are not tru matches\n",
    "\n",
    "For step 1 an LLM is used, but once a `./data/matching_fields.json` is created it is used. This is also useful as it means you can manually adjust this file to include/exclude fields as-needed. This file is very important for the matching algorithm and can be a good place to tune to matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) by selecting the installer that fits your OS version. Once it is installed you may have to restart your terminal (closing your terminal and opening again)\n",
    "2. In this directory, open terminal\n",
    "3. `conda env create -f environment.yml`\n",
    "4. `conda activate matching-env`\n",
    "5. Open this notebook in VS Code and use this environment\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You will need mentor and mentee data ...\n",

A person needs to be enlightened, to know about himself, to identify his own strength, abilities, and possibilities. \\nSelf-acceptance -refers to accepting one's own personality or image. There are many people who are unable to form a proper view of themselves and cannot take any decision.  In whatever form other people accept such people, they begin to accept them as their real nature. Their source of information about themselves is others point of view.\\nSocial Cohesion -Being helpful in the social life of an individual is also considered to be another important goal of counseling. The emergence of various problems in our life is also due to not being able to make proper adjustments with society. In order to understand social life and behavior and to work in accordance with socially accepted behavior, one has to abandon the limits of one's own personal limitations. \",\n",
